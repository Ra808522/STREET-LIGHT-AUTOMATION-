# Street Light Automation

## Project Overview
This project automates street lighting using an ESP32 microcontroller and a BH1750 ambient light sensor. The system turns on the lights only when it detects low light conditions, saving energy.

## Features
- Automated switching of street lights based on ambient light levels.
- Wi-Fi connectivity for remote monitoring and control.
- Energy-efficient design to reduce power consumption.

## Technologies Used
- ESP32 Microcontroller
- BH1750 Ambient Light Sensor
- Arduino IDE for programming
- ThingZmate platform for remote monitoring

## How to Use
1. Connect the BH1750 sensor and ESP32 as per the wiring diagram.
2. Upload the Arduino code provided in this repository.
3. Configure Wi-Fi credentials in the code.
4. Deploy the system to control street lights automatically.
